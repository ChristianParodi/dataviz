      <p>
        An important factor to consider is how much each region influences
        the global emissions and, respectively, which country of a specific region
        is the main responsable. In the following visualization, it's trivial
        to spot the world top emitter (i.e. China), as it outrace all the other
        countries by at least 5 billion of tonnes of CO2 emissions
